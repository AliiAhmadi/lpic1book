# 108.2. System logging

**Weight:** 3

**Description:** Candidates should be able to configure the syslog daemon. This objective also includes configuring the logging daemon to send log output to a central log server or accept log output as a central log server. Use of the systemd journal subsystem is covered. Also, awareness of rsyslog and syslog-ng as alternative logging systems is included.

**Key Knowledge Areas:**

* Configuration of the syslog daemon
* Understanding of standard facilities, priorities and actions
* Configuration of logrotate
* Awareness of rsyslog and syslog-ng

**Terms and Utilities:**

* syslog.conf
* syslogd
* klogd
* /var/log/
* logger
* logrotate
* /etc/logrotate.conf
* /etc/logrotate.d/
* journalctl
* /etc/systemd/journald.conf
* /var/log/journal/

#### Why Logging?

A Linux system has many subsystems and applications running. We use system logging to gather data about our running system from the moment it boots. Sometimes we just need to know that all is well. At other times we use this data for auditing, debugging, knowing when a disk or other resource is running out of capacity, and many other purposes. 

#### history 

Unfortunately linux logging is one of aspects of linux which is transition fase. The traditional syslog facility and its syslogd daemon provide this logging. Nowadays, syslog has been supplemented by other logging facilities such as rsyslog, syslog-ng, and the systemd journal subsystem.



syslog: Syslog is a standard for sending and receiving notification messages–in a particular format–from various network devices. The messages include time stamps, event messages, severity, host IP addresses, diagnostics and more.

syslogd:The syslog daemon is a server process that provides a message logging facility for application and system processes. The syslog daemon is started by the Internet Daemon and receives messages on well-known port 514. The syslog daemon must be started before any application program or system process that uses it starts.



* auth: used for many security events.
* authpriv: used for access-control-related messages.
* dæmon: used by system processes and other dæmons.
* kern: used for kernel messages.
* mark: messages generated by syslogd itself that contain only a timestamp and the string “--MARK--”. To specify how many minutes should transpire between marks, invoke syslogd with the -m \[minutes\] flag.
* user: the default facility when none is specified by an application or in a selector.
* local7: boot messages.
* \*: wildcard signifying “any facility”.
* none: wildcard signifying “no facility”.
