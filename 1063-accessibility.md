There are some people with disabilities .  A disability is any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or interact with the world around them. People with disabilities might like to work with Linux too . The good news is that Linux distributions provide great advantages over proprietary alternatives for people with disabilities! 

#### What is Accessibility?

Accessibilit, means making software usable by disabled people. That includes blind people of course, but also people who have low vision, are deaf, colorblind, have only one hand, can move only a few fingers, or even only the eyes.

### AccessX \(keyboard\)

 The **Keyboard Accessibility** preference tool allows you to set  some options for people who have difficulty with keyboard . The **Keyboard** accessibility preference tool is also known as **AccessX**.

* **Sticky keys**: Helps users who have trouble pressing multiple keys at once, and users who have use of only one hand
* **Slow keys** allows the user to specify the duration for which one must press-and-hold a **key** before the system accepts the keypress.
* **BounceKeys:** Requires a delay between keystrokes before accepting the next keypress .
* **MouseKeys:** Enables a group of  keys to emulate a mouse. Pressing keys in this group will move a pointer around the screen and perform mouse button actions.
* **RepeatKeys:** Enables the user who has trouble releasing keys quickly once they press to slow down how fast keys start repeating once they're pressed.

### Visual Settings

* **High-contrast** : Helps users who have trouble seeing text unless contrast is corrected, such as white text on a black background, or vice versa.
* **zoom \(Magnifier\)** : Helps users with visual impairments who need larger text and images.
* **Large Text**: Make reading text easier by using larger fonts in menus.
* **On screen keyboard**: Helps users who cannot type at all, but who can use a mouse.
